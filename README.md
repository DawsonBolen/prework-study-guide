# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This was created to help future bootcamp students with the prework section. It was built to help them navigate their way through the lessons and modules by providing notes and reccomending what to study first. I learned how to effectively use for loops along with functions to give a webpage more interactivity.
